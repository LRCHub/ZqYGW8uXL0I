Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hoping it would save me
Too many times, too many times

Whoa, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself, whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I got to tell them to myself, whoa
I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I gotta tell them ...

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, nowhere to turn
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn, I never learn

But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself, I do, I do, I do

One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I gotta tell them to myself, whoa
I got new rules, I count 'em, whoa
I gotta tell them ...

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I

Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't let him in, don't let him in, don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
I got new rules I count them
