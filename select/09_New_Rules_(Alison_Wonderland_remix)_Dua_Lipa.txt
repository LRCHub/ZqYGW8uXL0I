Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself

One: don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn (I never learn)
But my love (my love), he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One: don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

Yeah, aah, ah-ooh
Out again, aah-ooh
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em

Yeah, aah, ah-ooh
Out again
