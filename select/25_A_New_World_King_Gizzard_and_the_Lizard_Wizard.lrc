[00:09.64] As soon as the dust settles, you can see
[00:14.41] A new world in place of where the old one had been
[00:20.17] Your skin is crawling with dry, crusted mud
[00:25.31] And your naked feet are wet in a pool of blood
[00:30.52] And the whistle of the wind in your ears is so loud
[00:35.24] That your memories have blown up in a mushroom cloud
[00:40.25] And as your eyes accomodate, there appears by the meadow
[00:45.81] A brute like a bear with a long, dark shadow
[00:50.35] And you violently shake over what you have seen
[00:53.88] As you remember the tale of the Altered Beast
